# Terraform and Deployment of some servers.
This tutorial would guide us about introduction of terraform.we shall discuss the following:- 
1. Deploy a single server
2. Deploy a single web server
3. Deploy a configurable web server
4. Deploy a cluster of web servers
5. Deploy a load balancer
6. Clean up

we should must read first this [tutorial](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180#a9b0) and the code is explained in this 
[video part1](https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kapil_jain_shorthillstech_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44%2Fterraformfirst%20project%20%28part1%29%2Emp4&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44) and [video paet2](https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kapil_jain_shorthillstech_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44%2FTerraform%20Deployment%5F%20kaumudi%20%2Emp4&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44) to know the steps properly:-

 # Installation /Fundamentals of terraform:-
 * Install Terraform and AWS account[video](https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kapil_jain_shorthillstech_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44%2Fterraformfirst%20project%20%28part1%29%2Emp4&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44)
 * Deploy server and clean[video] (https://shorthillstech-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kapil_jain_shorthillstech_com/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44%2FTerraform%20Deployment%5F%20kaumudi%20%2Emp4&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fkapil%5Fjain%5Fshorthillstech%5Fcom%2FDocuments%2FTraining%2FDevOps%2F2022%2F44)

# STEPS TO RUN THE CODE AFTER WE CONFIGURE AWS ACCOUNT AND TERRAFORM ON OUR VIRTUAL M/C:-
1.Run terraform init command.It initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
     ```sh
terraform init
```
2.Run terraform plan command.It creates an execution plan,which lets you preview the changes that Terraform plans to make to our infrastructure.
     ```sh
terraform plan
```
3.Run terraform graph command(show us the dependency graph) 
    ```sh
terraform graph
```
4. Run terraform apply command. It perform the plan

```sh
terraform apply
```
    
5. Run curl http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080(to know the output ip address running status)
```sh
curl http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
```
    
6. Run terraform destroy command. It terminate the machine
       ```sh
terraform destroy
```
# DEPLOYMENT:-
Remove code from line no. 7 to 14 and from line no. 20 to 151.
# image
# Deploy a single server
1.Run the following commands:-

```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```
# Deploy a single web server
1.Make change in main.tf
#image
2.Run below commands:
```sh
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

3.Go to your aws instance and youâ€™ll see your new EC2 Instance deploying. Click your new Instance, copy its public IP address in the description panel at the bottom of the screen. Give the Instance a minute or two to boot up, and then use a web browser or a tool like curl to make an HTTP request to this IP address at port 8080. Run below commands.
```sh
curl http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080
   terraform destroy
```
